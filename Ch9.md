### 🧠 Section 6: Database Access Control: GRANT, REVOKE, Roles & Stored Procedures

#### ✅ GRANT & REVOKE: SQL Access Control

**GRANT** and **REVOKE** are Data Control Language (DCL) commands used to manage user permissions on database objects.

**GRANT Syntax:**

```sql
GRANT privilege_type ON object_name TO {user_name | role_name};
```

* **privilege\_type**: Permissions like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, EXECUTE, etc.
* **object\_name**: The database object (e.g., table, view, procedure).
* **user\_name/role\_name**: The user or role receiving the permission.

**Example:**

```sql
GRANT SELECT ON tblCustomers TO 'JaneDoe';
```

This grants 'JaneDoe' the ability to perform SELECT queries on the 'tblCustomers' table.

**REVOKE Syntax:**

```sql
REVOKE privilege_type ON object_name FROM {user_name | role_name};
```

* Removes previously granted permissions.

**Example:**

```sql
REVOKE SELECT ON tblCustomers FROM 'JaneDoe';
```

This revokes 'JaneDoe's SELECT permission on 'tblCustomers'.

---

#### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Roles: Grouping Permissions

Roles allow grouping of permissions, making it easier to manage user privileges.

**Creating a Role:**

```sql
CREATE ROLE role_name;
```

**Granting Permissions to a Role:**

```sql
GRANT privilege_type ON object_name TO role_name;
```

**Assigning a Role to a User:**

```sql
GRANT role_name TO user_name;
```

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE ROLE qa_tester;
GRANT CREATE TABLE TO qa_tester;
GRANT qa_tester TO 'JaneDoe';
```

This creates a role 'qa\_tester' with CREATE TABLE permission and assigns it to 'JaneDoe'.

**Dropping a Role:**

```sql
DROP ROLE role_name;
```

---

#### 🛡️ Stored Procedures: Controlled Data Access

Stored procedures are precompiled SQL statements stored in the database, allowing controlled and secure data operations.

**Creating a Stored Procedure:**

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name
AS
BEGIN
    -- SQL statements
END;
```

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE spGetCustomers
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM Customers;
END;
```

**Executing a Stored Procedure:**

```sql
EXECUTE spGetCustomers;
```

**Benefits:**

* Encapsulate complex operations.
* Restrict direct access to underlying tables.
* Enhance security by validating inputs and controlling outputs.

---

#### 🛡️ Preventing SQL Injection with Stored Procedures

Stored procedures can mitigate SQL injection risks by:

* Using parameterized queries.
* Avoiding dynamic SQL execution with unvalidated inputs.

**Safe Example:**

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetCustomerById @CustomerId INT
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerId = @CustomerId;
END;
```

**Unsafe Example (Vulnerable to SQL Injection):**

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE GetCustomerById @CustomerId VARCHAR(10)
AS
BEGIN
    EXEC('SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerId = ' + @CustomerId);
END;
```

The unsafe example concatenates user input directly into the SQL statement, making it susceptible to injection attacks.

---

#### 🔐 Summary

* **GRANT** and **REVOKE** manage user permissions on database objects.
* **Roles** simplify permission management by grouping privileges.
* **Stored Procedures** provide a secure way to perform database operations, encapsulating logic and restricting direct access.
